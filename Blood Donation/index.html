<h1>Blood Donation and its impact on society</h1>

<p>Donating one unit of blood may save the lives of up to three people, according to the American Red Cross. Blood donors provide a vital service to the community. Making a difference in the lives of others can boost a donor's sense of well-being. The benefits of donating blood include helping people injured in accidents, undergoing cancer treatment, and battling blood diseases, among other reasons. Unfortunately, current blood shortages are leading to delays in critical blood transfusions for people in need. Just 1 donation can save up to 3 lives. The average red blood cell transfusion is 3 pints (or 3 whole-blood donations). More than 1 million people every year are diagnosed with cancer for the first time.Every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood. It is essential for surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries. Whether a patient receives whole blood, red cells, platelets or plasma, this lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation.</p>

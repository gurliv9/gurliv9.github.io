<img src="https://secretnyc.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/timessquare.jpg" width="500" height="350"> 

<p>Bustling Times Square, famous for its flashing billboards, New Year's Eve count down, and constant throngs of people, lies at the heart of Midtown Manhattan. This intersection, in normal times, is really about the energy one feels when standing on the corner as taxi cabs rush by and lights flash overhead, rather than any individual site on the square. While it is an interesting place to visit during the day, it is probably best seen at night to experience the full impact. With its neon lights and billboards, Times Square is New York's most famous landmark and is the liveliest area in the city, located at the intersection of Broadway and 7th Avenue. In Times Square you will find bars, restaurants, theatres, museums and a great atmosphere. On New Years Times Square New Year's Eve Ball is raised up a 77-foot flagpole at the top of One Times Square at approximately 6PM. A few good places to watch are along Broadway (43rd Street - 50th Street), and along Seventh Avenue, as far north as 59th Street.<br><br></p><br>

<p>Hollywood is the thriving, pulsing center of the film and entertainment industry, where visitors might brush shoulders with celebrities at a bar or grocery store. It’s an exciting town with a lot of history, great restaurants, and unique hotels. From the glamour of the Dolby Theatre to the artistry of Hollyhock House, Hollywood has it all. Be sure to call the attractions and restaurants ahead of your visit to confirm current opening times. Perhaps the most iconic landmark of Los Angeles is the Hollywood Sign, spelled out in huge white letters that are almost 45 feet tall. The sign can be seen from all over LA, and it’s one of Southern California’s most strictly protected landmarks. It was first built in the 1920s, when it read “HOLLYWOODLAND” and was actually just an advertisement for real estate developments, but over the years it has become a treasured and iconic cultural point of interest, recognizable around the world. Located in Griffith Park, visitors can get close to the Hollywood Sign via a short hike, although access to the sign is very strictly off limits and punishable by a $1,000 fine.<br><br>

<p>This incredible natural attraction is one of the most visited places in the United States. Carved out by the Colorado River, the Grand Canyon cuts deep into the landscape, creating dramatic cliff walls and ledges. Visitors standing on the rim of the canyon can see down to the canyon floor a mile below, and look out over the ridges and cliffs that run as far as the eye can see.

    The South Rim, about 4.5 hours by car from Las Vegas, is the most visited section of Grand Canyon National Park. This is where you'll find a large visitor center, regular bus service along the Rim in the high season, and a walkway that runs along the canyon with numerous viewing points and platforms. Several wonderful hikes, including the Bright Angel Trail, leave from here.<br><br></p>

    <p>Situated along the Canada-US border, Niagara Falls is one of the most famous waterfalls in the world. The water from Lake Erie flows into Lake Ontario over these massive waterfalls, known for the great quantity of water that is constantly tumbling over the vertical drop. Niagara Falls is actually a set of three falls: It consists of the largest section, known as Horseshoe Falls, with a drop of 187 feet; a second section on the American side of the river, known as the American Falls, with a drop of 89 feet; and a much thinner section located next to the American Falls, known as Bridal Veil Falls, with a drop of 78 feet.<br>Views are good on both sides of the river, but the Canadian side gives a very different perspective and is worth a visit if you don't mind crossing the border into Canada.<br><br></p>

            <p>Arching across San Francisco Bay, joining San Francisco and Marin County, the Golden Gate Bridge has been a California icon since it was built in the 1930s. Contrasting with the blue water, the bridge's orangish-red color is an aesthetic accent that brings a unique quality to the city. It also has a unique presence when it's shrouded in fog with just the peaks of the main towers projecting through the low-lying cloud. The bridge is approximately two miles long and part of Hwy 101 or SR 1. If the day is clear, one of the best viewing spots is on Conzelman Road, located in Golden Gate National Recreation Area.<br><br></p><br>

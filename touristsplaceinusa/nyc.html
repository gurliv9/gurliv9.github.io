<p>New York City comprises 5 boroughs sitting where the Hudson River meets the Atlantic Ocean. At its core is Manhattan, a densely populated borough that’s among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers. Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building and sprawling Central Park. Broadway theater is staged in neon-lit Times Square. New York is a city of diversity and dynamism. It is also a city of politics, economy and culture. It is even described as the economic and cultural capital of the world, and New York City is one of the most populous cities in the United States. NYC got the nickname "The Big Apple" originated in the 1920s in reference to the prizes (or "big apples") rewarded at the many racing courses in and around New York City. However, it wasn't officially adopted as the city's nickname until 1971 as the result of a successful ad campaign intended to attract tourists. New York City is the largest and most influential American metropolis and the most populous and the most international city in the country. New York City is called the City of Dreams for a reason. It was originally called Longacre Square until the Times moved there in 1904. New York City became the first capital of the United States in 1789. More Chinese people live in New York City than any other city outside of Asia. More Jewish people live there than any other city outside of Israel. This city is perfect for college graduates, as the city's businesses offer world-class internships in all the major industries. The city also offers unparalleled access to the arts community for those who wish to pursue life-long dreams as artists. A trip to New York is worth the expenditure of time and money if you set realistic expectations, but probably not if you're expecting your life to be changed. New York is a diverse, dynamic city with some of the best food and most recognizable landmarks in the world. New York City may be number one in our hearts — but it doesn't even crack the top 50 when it comes to quality of life. This is according to US News & World Report's 2019 list of best places to live in America, which ranked the so-called “greatest city in the world” all the way down at 90th place out of 125 cities.</p>

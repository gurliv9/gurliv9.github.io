<p>Montana Is Full of Great Places to Live. Although far down the list of most populous states, Montana has two cities ranked among Livability's 2018 Top 100 Best Places to Live. The college towns of Bozeman, home of Montana State University, is ranked No. 96; and Missoula, home to the University of Montana is ranked 59. Montana is most famous for its natural beauty, diverse wildlife, and abundance of natural mineral resources. That is why it is called the “Treasure State”. The Rocky Mountains and Yellowstone National Park are two of the state's most well-known features. The state boasts a thriving agricultural industry and low unemployment rates, while also offering endless opportunities for adventure and a rare chance for peace and quiet. But life in Montana, with its unpredictable weather, booming property market, open-range laws, and throngs of tourists, isn't for everyone. The cold season lasts for 3.2 months, from November 18 to February 25, with an average daily high temperature below 40°F. The coldest month of the year in Montana City is December, with an average low of 14°F and high of 31°F. Despite increasing violent crime, 31% of Montana residents feel safe in their state. Those living in The Big Sky Country also appear to have considerably lower concern for gun violence. 66% of Montanans reported feeling safe in their state compared to 55% of Americans. According to MERIC data in the third quarter of 2021, Montana ranks 30th when it comes to cost of living. That means Montana is more expensive to live in than half of the country. Montana Was Ranked #1. A Gallup poll recently surveyed all 50 states to find out what residents say about their state. It was no surprise to us that Montana came out on top of the list for the best places to live! 77% of Montana residents said their state was the best or one of the best possible states to live in.</p>

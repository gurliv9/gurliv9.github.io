<p>Missouri's second-largest city, St. Louis, is known for its beer, baseball, and The Blues hockey team, especially after its 2019 Stanley Cup win. But the city has more to offer than just a few late night sports games and some brews. During the 19th-Century, St. Louis grew into an important center of commerce and trade, attracting thousands of immigrants eager to find a new life on the edge of the frontier. Between 1840 and 1860, the population exploded with the arrival of many new immigrants. St. Louis saw additional prosperity as the gateway to the west, outfitting many a wagon train, trapper, miner, and trader. By the time the construction of the railroads began in the early 1850s, St. Louis had a population of almost 80,000 people. Louis is alive with energy and excitement from the iconic Gateway Arch to our miles of trails, parks and waterways ready to explore. With a host of world-class, family and budget-friendly attractions and a cultural scene second to none, you're sure to be entertained and surprised by all St. Louis has to offer.</p>
